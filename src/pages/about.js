                        My name is Sam Reichle (rÄ«k-lee), and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer striving to create high-quality, conducive websites and web applications. 
                        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems at The University of Alabama. Roll Tide!
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        My time at The University of Alabama has been spent gaining the knowledge and skills necessary to become proficient in the design and development of IT. 
                        I have worked with HTML5, CSS, ES6/ES7JavaScript and frameworks including React and Gatsby to build cutting-edge websites and applications. 
                        I have learned the syntax and design patterns of Java and built applications that add, pull, and manipulate data from a SQL database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work experiences have taught me the importance of adaptability, communication, and planning. I value hard work and perseverance and believe these to be important components for success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My long-term goal is to become a senior software engineer, but I am currently looking to join a web development team at an innovative company where I can make an immediate impact.
