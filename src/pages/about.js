                            I'm Sam Reichle (rÄ«k-lee), a Web Developer striving to create high-quality, conducive websites and web applications that will enrich the lives of their users. 
                            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems at The University of Alabama. Roll Tide!
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            My time at The University of Alabama and work as a web developer has equipped me with the knowledge and skills necessary to become proficient in the design and development of IT. 
                            I have learned the nuances of building enterprise applications using industry wide standardized tools and frameworks.
                            I have gained proficiency in understanding requirements, architecting a solution, and implementing the solution as running software.
                            Most of all, I have acquired valuable experience working with teams of other professionals to create and implement strategies that result in meaningful projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My long-term goal is to become a senior software engineer, but I am currently looking to join a web development team at an innovative company where I can make an immediate impact.
